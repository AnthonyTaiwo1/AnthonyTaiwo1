### Hi there, My name is Anthony Taiwo ðŸ‘‹
I am a recent Electrical and Electronic Engineering graduate with a passion for tech. I possess strong analytical and technical skills gained through creating innovative designs, circuit design, testing tools, power electronic systems and software development. I have some knowledge of many programming languages these include C++, HTML,CSS, JavaScript, VHDL and microprocessor. I have made projects using these software languages that can be found on my GitHub profile. I do plan to improve my knowledge on the listed programming languages.
